# Loan-eligibility-prediction
This project aims to predict the eligibility of loan applicants using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing various features of the applicants such as income, education, employment status, and credit history, the model will determine whether an applicant qualifies for a loan. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation using Python and popular data science libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

This project utilizes the following algorithms:

### Decision Tree Algorithm

A Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It splits the data into subsets based on the most significant attribute to maximize information gain.

### Naive Bayes Theorem & Naive Bayes Classification

Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' Theorem, assuming independence between predictors.

## Why Python?

Python is a popular programming language in Data Science due to its simplicity, readability, and extensive libraries.

## Python Libraries

### NumPy

NumPy is a library for numerical computations in Python.

### Pandas

Pandas is a library for data manipulation and analysis.

### Scikit-learn

Scikit-learn is a library for machine learning in Python.

### Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a library for data visualization.

## Project Implementation

In this project, we will implement the Loan Eligibility Prediction model using the above-mentioned algorithms and libraries.

## Installation

To get started with the project, install the required libraries:

```sh
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
